## About

This repository contains a collection of mini projects that I have created. The projects are created for learning purposes and to showcase my skills.

## Projects

You can find the list of projects [here](https://klpod221.site/mini-projects/).

## For Developers

Almost all projects use basic html, css, js so you can easily understand and modify them.
If a project uses a framework or another language, I will provide specific instructions in the README.md file of that project.

If you want to contribute to this repository, you can fork this repository or clone it to yourself. I will not accept pull requests because this repository is for my personal projects only. But if you find a bug or have a suggestion, you can create an issue. I very much appreciate your help.
